    "instructions": "1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add chicken; continue to boil until no longer pink in the middle, 15 to 20 minutes. Let sit until cool enough to handle, then dice into small bite-sized pieces.\n2. While chicken cooks, bring a second large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and rinse under cool water.\n3. At the same time, place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes.\n4. Remove eggs from hot water and hold under cold running water to cool. Peel and dice eggs.\n5. Mix mayonnaise, sugar, vinegar, onion salt, salt, mustard, and pepper together in a large bowl. Mix in diced eggs, pasta, and chicken, adding a little more mayonnaise if too dry. Chill for at least 1 hour, or up to 8 hours or overnight before serving.",
