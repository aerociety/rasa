    "instructions": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Rub chicken breast with olive oil and vinegar, then rub brown sugar onto the chicken until you've got a nice glaze coat. Grill chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). While the chicken is cooking, combine peaches, tomato, grapes, onion, lemon juice, and honey in a bowl; mix thoroughly. Dice the cooked chicken and serve on top of the salsa.",
