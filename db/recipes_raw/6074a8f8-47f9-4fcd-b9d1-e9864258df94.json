Melt white chocolate chips with milk in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth. 5. Mix together Neufchatel cheese and ½ cup sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Blend in vanilla extract and melted white chocolate. 6. Pour half the batter over crust. Spoon 3 tablespoons raspberry sauce over batter. Pour remaining cheesecake batter into pan and spoon 3 more tablespoons of raspberry sauce over batter. Swirl batter with tip of knife to create marbled effect. 7. Place pan in a roasting pan and fill roasting pan with hot water to reach halfway up outside of pan. 8. Bake in preheated oven until filling is set, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool completely. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 8 hours before removing from pan. Serve with remaining raspberry sauce.",
