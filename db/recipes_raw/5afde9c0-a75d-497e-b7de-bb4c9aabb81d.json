    "instructions": "1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 2. Make the crust: Pulse cookies in a food processor until finely crushed. Add margarine and pulse until well blended. Press crumb mixture into the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan. Refrigerate until ready to use. 3. Make the filling: Beat cream cheese in a large bowl with electric mixer at medium speed until creamy. Mix in sugar and cornstarch until well blended. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in bananas, cream, and vanilla until well combined. Pour filling into chilled crust and place the pan on a baking sheet. 4. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) and continue baking until the center is almost set, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and set on a wire rack. 5. Run the tip of a table knife around the edges of the pan and allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature, about 1 hour. Refrigerate until completely chilled, 4 hours to overnight. 6. When ready to serve, make the whipped cream: Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until frothy. Gradually mix in sugar and vanilla; continue to beat until soft peaks form. 7. Spread whipped cream over chilled cheesecake.",
