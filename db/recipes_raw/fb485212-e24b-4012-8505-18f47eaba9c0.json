Meanwhile, make cheesecake batter. 4. For the cheesecake: Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. 5. Immediately spoon cheesecake mixture over brownie layer. Place in water bath and continue baking for 45 to 50 minutes or until center is set. Cool to room temperature. 6.
