Beat sugar and butter together in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in vanilla. Sift 2 ¾ cups flour, baking powder, and salt together into a bowl; gradually stir flour mixture into butter mixture. Place remaining 1/4 cup flour into a small bowl. Add peaches and toss to coat, then fold floured peaches into batter. Spread batter evenly into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.",
