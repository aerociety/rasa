    "instructions": "1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil, toss, and set aside. 2. Heat remaining olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Add bell pepper, carrot, onion, broccoli, cauliflower, and seasoned salt. Cook, stirring, until broccoli turns a deep bright green and onion is beginning to turn translucent, about 3 minutes. 3. Toss vegetables with pasta and refrigerate salad for 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld and cool. 4. Remove cooled salad from refrigerator and toss with mayonnaise and balsamic vinegar. Season with more seasoned salt if needed. Garnish with fresh basil.",
