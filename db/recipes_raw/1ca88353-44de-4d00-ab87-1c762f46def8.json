    "instructions": "1. Heat olive oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cook shrimp in hot oil until bright pink on the outside and meat is opaque, about 5 minutes. Immediately immerse shrimp in a bowl of cold water and let cool for at least 10 minutes. 2. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 11 minutes. 3. Drain pasta and transfer to a large bowl. Add shrimp, mayonnaise, sour cream, peas, celery, red onion, lemon juice, dill, sugar, salt, and pepper to the bowl; stir until well combined. Adjust seasonings to taste. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving.",
