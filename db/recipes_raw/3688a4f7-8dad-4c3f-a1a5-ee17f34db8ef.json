    "instructions": "1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wrap the outside of a 9-inch springform pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil. 2. Combine flour, pecans, butter, brown sugar, and vanilla extract in a bowl; press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. 3. Bake crust for 10 to 12 minutes; remove from oven and let cool. 4. Beat cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth. Gradually beat in sugar, then cornstarch. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. 5. Add pureed bananas, sour cream, lemon juice, rum, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt; beat until just combined. Pour filling over the crust. 6. Place the springform pan in a roasting pan; add enough water to come halfway up the sides. 7. Bake until center is just set, about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Turn off the oven and leave cheesecake inside for 2 hours. Refrigerate uncovered for 1 hour, then cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. 8. Carefully loosen the edges and remove the pan sides. 9. Warm caramel sauce in a pan over low heat; mix in rum. 10. Decorate the cheesecake with whipped topping, pecans, and arrange banana slices around the edge. Drizzle with caramel sauce.",
