    "instructions": "1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add elbow pasta to the boiling water and cook, stirring for the first 2 minutes and occasionally thereafter, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes total or according to package directions. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop cooking. Transfer to a large bowl. 2. Spread 1/4 cup mayonnaise on top of the cooked pasta and add chipotle ranch dressing. Mix throughout to keep pasta from sticking. 3. Add chicken breast meat, green onions, mushrooms, olives, celery seed, dill, onion powder, and thyme. Gently stir together with the pasta. 4. Add remaining mayonnaise to desired consistency. Add grape tomatoes and mix gently, being careful not to break any. 5. Refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.",
