    "instructions": "1. Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add 1 tablespoon salt. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. 2. Combine vinegar, sugar, dill, and parsley in a large bowl. Muddle the herbs with flat spatula and mix until sugar is dissolved. Whisk in mayonnaise, lime juice, and 1 teaspoon salt until creamy. Stir in celery and onion. Cover and refrigerate. 3. Rinse pasta under cold water. Fold pasta into the dressing until evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate, folding salad occasionally so that dressing is evenly absorbed, 8 hours to overnight. Add more mayonnaise if pasta looks dry. 4. Gently fold in shrimp in the last fold before serving.",
