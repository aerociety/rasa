    "instructions": "1. Wash the kale and spin dry in a salad spinner. Remove the leaves from the thick stems and pat them dry with kitchen towels. 2. Place the leaves in a bowl, add salt, paprika, some paprika powder, and curry powder. Drizzle with olive oil and massage the spices into the leaves. Spread them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. 3. To ensure the kale becomes crispy in the oven, it's important to bake the leaves at a low temperature of 120-140°C. (For convection, do not exceed 110°C.) To allow moist air to escape quickly and make the chips nice and crispy, wedge a wooden spoon in the oven door. The kale leaves should bake for about 30 minutes but check regularly as baking time can vary depending on the oven.",
