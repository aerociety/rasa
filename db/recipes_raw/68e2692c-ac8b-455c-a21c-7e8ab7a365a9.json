    "instructions": "1. Add olive oil, orange juice, lime juice, garlic, cumin, coriander, cayenne, paprika, salt, and pepper to a gallon-sized zip-top bag. Seal and gently squeeze the ingredients together until combined. Add chicken thighs, press out most of the air, and seal. 2. Lay the bag flat in the refrigerator so that the chicken thighs are in a single layer. Marinade for at least 4 hours, turning the bag over every 2 hours. 3. Prepare the salsa before lighting the grill. Combine peaches, cherries, cilantro, jalapeno, red onion, and lime juice in a medium bowl. Toss gently and refrigerate. 4. Clean and preheat a gas grill to medium heat, about 20 minutes. 5. Brush grill grates with olive oil. Remove chicken thighs from the marinade. Discard the marinade. Grill chicken in a single layer until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve with salsa.",
