In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, and baking powder. Pour reserved peach juice into flour mixture and stir until smooth. 4. Remove the glass pan from the oven and pour in batter starting in the center; batter will spread over the entire pan. Add peaches by placing them in the center of the pan; allow peaches to spread on their own. 5. Bake cobbler in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until just brown on top.",
