    "instructions": "1. Place chicken into a large zip-top freezer bag. \n2. Combine red chile peppers, garlic, lemongrass, olive oil, fish sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and sea salt in a food processor. Blend until finely chopped and combined. Pour marinade into the freezer bag, making sure chicken is well coated. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, or up to overnight. \n3. Remove chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking to allow to come to room temperature. \n4. Heat a large cast iron or nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in batches until golden and caramelized on the outside and no longer pink in the centers, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and cut into thick slices using a sharp knife. \n5. Place sugar in a medium bowl. Add lemon juice and stir to dissolve. Stir in water and fish sauce, followed by garlic and chile pepper. Allow flavors to settle, 5 to 10 minutes. Taste and adjust for seasoning; add more lemon juice or sugar as needed. \n6. Meanwhile, place noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot water. Set aside until noodles are softened, about 15 minutes. \n7. Place cooked noodles into serving bowls. Top with chicken, lettuce, cucumber, carrot, cilantro, mint, and sauce.",
