    "instructions": "1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook chicken breasts in the boiling water until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 12 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Rinse chicken in cold water to cool, cut into small chunks, and refrigerate to cool completely. 2. In another pot, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook shell pasta in the boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and rinse with cold water to cool. 3. In a large bowl, stir together mayonnaise, yogurt, and curry powder. Add cold chicken, pasta, peas, radishes, and green onions; stir to combine. 4. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving.",
