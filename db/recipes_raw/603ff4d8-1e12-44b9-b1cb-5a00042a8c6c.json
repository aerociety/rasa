    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan and wrap it in aluminum foil. For the crust, mix graham cracker crumbs and brown sugar, then stir in melted butter and press into the bottom of the pan. Bake until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Cool. For the filling, beat cream cheese until creamy, gradually add 1 cup sugar, and beat in egg yolks one at a time. Mix in sour cream, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla. In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form, gradually adding 1/3 cup sugar until stiff peaks form. Fold meringue into the cream cheese mixture gently. Pour the filling into the crust. Place the springform pan in a larger pan and fill the larger pan with hot water to 1 inch up the sides of the springform pan. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes. Turn off the oven, prop the door open, and let the cheesecake sit for 1 more hour. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours. For the topping, cook 1 cup blueberries and remaining sugar in a saucepan until berries break down. Strain the mixture to reserve juice. Combine with remaining blueberries and lemon juice. Pour the topping over the cheesecake before serving.",
