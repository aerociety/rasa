    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add shallots; cook and stir to soften, 1 minute. Add pears; cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add white wine, brown sugar, thyme, salt, and black pepper. Increase heat to medium-high; simmer until liquid has evaporated and pears have lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. Set aside. Cut a Brie-sized hole in the top of the sourdough round to within 1/2-inch of the bottom. Cut the removed bread into pieces for serving; set aside. Score Brie around the edge (halfway down the Brie wheel) using a paring knife to cut 1/4-inch deep. Cut Brie in half horizontally. Place the bottom half of Brie, cut-side up, into the sourdough loaf. Top with 1/2 of the pear mixture; sprinkle with 1/2 of the slivered almonds. Place the remaining Brie half on top; spread with the remaining pear mixture and sprinkle with the remaining slivered almonds. Place on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until soft and gooey, about 45 minutes. Serve with reserved sourdough bread and crackers.",
