    "instructions": "1. Gather the ingredients. 2. Make crust: Sift together flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. Work in shortening with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk together egg and cold water in a small bowl. Sprinkle over flour mixture; work with hands to form dough into a ball. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. 3. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Roll out half of the chilled dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Place in a 9x13-inch baking dish, covering the bottom and halfway up the sides. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. 4. Make filling: Mix peaches, orange juice, and lemon juice in a large saucepan. Add butter and cook over medium-low heat until butter is melted. Stir together sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl; mix into peach mixture until combined. Pour into baked crust. 5. Roll remaining dough to 1/4-inch thickness, cut into strips, and create a lattice over the filling. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar, then drizzle with melted butter. 6. Bake until top crust is golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.",
