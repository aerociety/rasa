    "instructions": "Mix soy sauce, brown sugar, sherry, sesame oil, ginger, and garlic powder together in a shallow glass dish. Stir in chicken pieces and pineapple chunks until well coated. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Thread chicken and pineapple alternately onto skewers. Discard excess marinade. Cook on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
