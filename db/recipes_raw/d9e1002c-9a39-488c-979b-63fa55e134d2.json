Fry the meat in portions in the bacon fat, seasoning with salt and pepper. 2. Peel the carrot, 2 onions, and garlic. Dice everything finely and sauté in the remaining fat. Add the meat and bacon back in. Sprinkle everything with flour and sauté briefly. Stir in the tomato paste. Deglaze with ½ liter of water and the wine. Add the broth, bay leaves, and thyme, and bring to a boil. 3. Cover the goulash and simmer on the stove or in the preheated oven at 200°C (upper/lower heat) or gas mark 3 for about 1 ½ hours. 4. Clean and wash the mushrooms. Peel the remaining onions. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan. Sauté both and season. Add them to the meat 30 minutes before the end of the cooking time. Taste the goulash and add finely chopped parsley before serving. 5. Serve with spaetzle, potato croquettes, or a bread dumpling, and optionally red cabbage.",
