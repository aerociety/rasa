    "instructions": "1. Pat the beef roulades dry with paper towels. Cut the onions into half-moons and the pickles into strips. Prepare kitchen twine and scissors.\n2. Spread mustard thinly on the open roulades, season with salt and pepper. Distribute half an onion, 1.5 slices of bacon, and 0.5 pickles (possibly more) in the center lengthwise on each roulade. Fold the sides slightly inward, roll tightly, and tie with kitchen twine.\n3. Heat clarified butter in a pan and sear the roulades on all sides. Remove and transfer to a braising pot.\n4. Chop the celeriac, remaining onion, leek, and carrot, and sauté in the pan. Once lightly browned, deglaze with a thin layer of red wine without stirring and let the liquid evaporate. Repeat this process until half a bottle of wine is used, achieving a nice brown color for flavor.\n5. Add beef stock, adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, and splash cucumber liquid before adding to the pot with the roulades. Cover the pot.\n6. Simmer either on low heat or in a preheated oven at 160 °C for 1.5 hours, occasionally adding a bit of liquid if necessary.\n7. After 1.5 hours, check if the roulades are tender. If not, continue braising for another 30 minutes. Remove the roulades carefully and keep warm.\n8. Strain the sauce through a sieve and bring it to a boil. Mix 1 tablespoon of mustard with a bit of water and cornstarch, and gradually whisk into the boiling sauce until the desired thickness is reached. Adjust seasoning before serving.",
