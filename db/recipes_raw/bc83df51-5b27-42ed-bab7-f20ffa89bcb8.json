    "instructions": "1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly spray a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray. Stir together graham crackers and brown sugar in a small bowl, then drizzle with coconut oil and stir. Add just enough non-dairy milk to make crumbs stick together. Press firmly into the bottom of the pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Keep oven at 350 degrees F. 2. Meanwhile, blend cheesecake-batter ingredients in a blender until completely smooth. This takes about 1 minute with a high-powered blender or about 5 minutes with a standard blender. 3. Spray the inside of the springform pan above the baked crust with cooking spray. Pour in the batter and spread evenly. Bake until the top is lightly puffed and edges are golden, 45 to 50 minutes. 4. Cool to room temperature on a rack, then chill for at least 3 hours or overnight. 5. Slice the cake with a thin, sharp knife dipped in water. Serve with whipped topping, dust with cinnamon, and sprinkle with candied ginger.",
