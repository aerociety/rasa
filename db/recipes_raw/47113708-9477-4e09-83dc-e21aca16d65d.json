    "instructions": "1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. 2. For the dressing: Whisk 4 tablespoons of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, shallot, Dijon mustard, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt together in a bowl until well mixed. 3. Brush 1 teaspoon of olive oil onto the cut side of the peaches. 4. Place peaches, cut-side down, onto the grill and cook until heated through, about 4 minutes. Transfer peaches to a plate. 5. Brush remaining oil onto both sides of the chicken breasts and season with salt. 6. Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Slice chicken into thin pieces and cut peaches into 1/2-inch thick pieces. 7. Toss arugula and dressing together in a bowl. Divide dressed arugula among plates; top with peaches and chicken.",
