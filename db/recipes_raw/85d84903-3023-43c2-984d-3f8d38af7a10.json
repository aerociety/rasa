Make the salad: Combine lettuce, chicken, green onions, and sesame seeds in a large bowl. Cover and chill for 10 minutes. While the salad is chilling, heat oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Break rice noodles into pieces and fry in the hot skillet in small batches until they begin to puff up, 15 to 25 seconds. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Remove salad from the refrigerator. Portion into salad bowls, top with fried rice noodles, and drizzle dressing over top.",
