    "instructions": "1. Whisk rice wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, garlic, pinch of salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; slowly whisk in 2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, whisking constantly. Transfer vinaigrette to a jar with a tight-fitting lid. 2. Set an oven rack to the highest position and preheat the oven's broiler on high. 3. Toss zucchini and bell pepper with 2 tablespoons olive oil; season with salt and black pepper. Arrange on a large baking sheet with sides. 4. Broil in the preheated oven until spotty brown, 8 to 10 minutes, flipping zucchini slices and pepper halves once. Transfer to a large bowl to cool, then cut into bite-sized pieces. 5. Fill a large pot with 1 gallon water and 2 tablespoons salt; bring to a boil. Add shells and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain thoroughly (do not rinse); transfer to the baking sheet. Set aside to cool. 6. Transfer zucchini, bell pepper, pasta shells, shrimp, tomatoes, feta cheese, olives, onion, and oregano to a bowl or gallon-sized resealable plastic bag. When ready to serve, add vinaigrette; toss to coat.",
