Add chicken; seal and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 4 hours. Whisk 1/4 cup of oil into remaining mixture for dressing. Peel and section oranges. Sprinkle asparagus with oil, salt, and pepper. Build a fire on one side of the grill. When coals are covered with white ash, place chicken on rack over direct heat, cover and grill for 4 to 6 minutes. Turn, cover and grill another 4 to 6 minutes. Remove chicken and add asparagus, grilling for 3 to 5 minutes. Let chicken stand for 5 minutes and cut into slices. Toss greens, oranges, salt and pepper with most of the dressing. Arrange salad in shallow bowls and place chicken and asparagus on top. Drizzle with remaining dressing.",
