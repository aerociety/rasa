Add chicken, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 15-18 minutes, turning chicken once, until juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink. Remove chicken from liquid and set aside to cool. 2. In a small skillet, stir together the paprika and remaining thyme over medium-low heat for 2 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together the toasted paprika mixture, mayonnaise, sour cream, salt, ground pepper, and nutmeg until evenly blended. 3. Cube cooled chicken and transfer to a medium bowl. Add prepared dressing, corn, cilantro, orange pepper, and jalapeno and toss until evenly coated. Serve warm, or refrigerate until ready to serve.",
