    "instructions": "Mix the dry ingredients together, which yields about a small jar full. Personal variations in the choice and amount of ingredients are expressly encouraged. For a smaller amount of meat, mix 2 teaspoons of the blend with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, and if desired, crushed garlic. Brush the meat of your choice with this mixture. The blend is also great as a rub for pulled pork. For this, thinly brush the meat with a mixture of finely puréed garlic, a little olive oil, and mustard before sprinkling the spice powder on top. This spice is also suitable for grilled chicken or minced meat dishes, such as stuffed peppers. Tip: If you can get it, I really recommend using smoked paprika, it's truly a fine thing.",
