    "instructions": "Wrap the bottom and sides of an 8-inch springform pan with aluminum foil. Combine graham cracker crumbs, butter, and salt in a bowl; mix thoroughly. Pour into the prepared pan; press tightly onto the bottom and up the sides of the pan using the bottom of a measuring cup. Freeze crust until firm, 10 to 15 minutes. Beat cream cheese, Neufchatel cheese, and 3/4 cup sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy, about 4 minutes. Beat in eggs one at a time; add vanilla. Beat in heavy cream. Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 2 minutes. Beat melted chocolate into the cream cheese mixture. Fold in flour. Pour chocolate cream cheese mixture over the chilled crust. Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Pour 1 1/2 cup water into the pot of an electric pressure cooker. Place the steam rack in the pot; set springform pan on top. Close and lock the lid. Set timer for 45 minutes. Set to high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 15 minutes. Release pressure naturally according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool cheesecake to room temperature, about 1 hour. Combine cherries, apricot jam, and 2 tablespoons sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Simmer until cherries are heated through and release some of their juices, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix water and cornstarch in a small bowl until smooth. Stir into the cherry mixture until thick and glossy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat; cool glaze to room temperature. Pour glaze over cheesecake and refrigerate until firm, at least 6 hours or overnight. Remove the springform ring and transfer cheesecake to a serving platter.",
