        "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).",
        "Mix graham cracker crumbs, pecans, bacon bits, maple syrup, butter, vanilla extract, and salt together in a medium bowl. Press mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan for a 1/4-inch-thick crust. Reserve extra crumbs for the sides.",
        "Bake crust in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Let cool slightly.",
        "Beat cream cheese, maple syrup, and sugar until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add heavy cream, vanilla, almond, and lemon extracts; blend until smooth.",
        "Push filling through a sieve for a smooth texture. Wrap the outer pan in foil, covering the underside and extending to the top. Place in a roasting pan, pour hot water halfway up the sides, and fill with creamy mixture.",
        "Bake until cheesecake edges are puffed and center jiggles slightly, about 1 hour. Turn off the oven and leave the door slightly open for an hour to cool.",
        "Remove from oven, let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Refrigerate until completely chilled, at least 4 hours or preferably 24-48 hours.",
        "For the topping, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with foil, lay bacon in a single layer, brush with 1/4 cup maple syrup.",
        "Bake until bacon is halfway crispy, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain grease. Coat the other side with more maple syrup and bake for an additional 10 minutes until crispy.",
        "Cool bacon, cut into small strips, and scatter over the cheesecake before serving."
