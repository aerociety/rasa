Pour 1/2 of this mixture into a large, resealable plastic bag, and add the chicken breasts. Seal, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. In a large salad bowl, toss romaine lettuce with oranges, celery, and green onions. Set aside. Lightly oil the grate, and place chicken on the grill. Discard the marinade from the chicken. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes on each side, or until juices run clear when pierced with a fork. Remove chicken from the grill, and slice into thin strips. Toss salad with reserved dressing, and top with sliced chicken.",
